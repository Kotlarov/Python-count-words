I recently read the book Frankenstein and was surprised by how often the author uses the word countenance.
A friend said the word endeavour occurs way more often - so I had to write a script to check on this.

The script counts "countenance" and "endeavour" with all endings.
In addition, it counts the top n words with x letters (here n=20 and x=9) as a comparison. The counting of all words does not group similar ones!

The 20 most common words with at least 9 letters:

Elizabeth: 85
miserable: 59
happiness: 44
sometimes: 38
mountains: 35
affection: 34
therefore: 34
possessed: 30
discovered: 29
countenance: 29
continued: 28
Frankenstein: 27
endeavoured: 27
companion: 26
beautiful: 26
appearance: 25
knowledge: 25
sensations: 24
existence: 24
creatures: 23

countenances, countenance: 37

endeavours, endeavoured, endeavour, endeavouring: 52

Who was right depends on whether you consider the different variations of the word or not!
