# Project description
I recently read the book Frankenstein and was surprised by how often the author uses the word _countenance_.
A friend said the word _endeavour_ occurs way more often - so I had to write a script to check on this.
The script counts _countenance_ and _endeavour_ with all endings. 
In addition, it counts the top n words with x letters (here n=20 and x=9) as a comparison. The counting of all words does not group similar ones.

The 20 most common words with at least nine letters:

Elizabeth: 85
miserable: 59
happiness: 44
sometimes: 38
mountains: 35
affection: 34
therefore: 34
possessed: 30
discovered: 29
__countenance: 29__
continued: 28
Frankenstein: 27
__endeavoured: 27__
companion: 26
beautiful: 26
appearance: 25
knowledge: 25
sensations: 24
existence: 24
creatures: 23

_Countenance_ appears 29 times whereas _endeavoured_ only 27! But if you include all the different word endings you get:  
_countenances, countenance:_ 37 and _endeavours, endeavoured, endeavour, endeavouring:_ 52  

__Counting all endings, the word _endeavour_ occurs more often in the book.__
